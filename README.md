# UAlbany-IEEE-Website
The code for the official website of the UAlbany IEEE for the 2020-2021 School Year. Makes extensive use of 3JS technology.
 
## Background
After being elected as student chair of the UAlbany IEEE for the 2020-2021 School Year, I decided that our website needed a serious overhaul. After a bit of deliberation I decided to take an unconventional approach and do the entire site as a 3D first person world, really hoping to make it stand out so we could enter it in the IEEE annual student branch website contest. I decided to use 3js since I have been working with it on and off for 3d web applications for the past few years, rather than writing my own 3d engine from the ground up with WebGL, which as fun as that would be, was beyond the scope of this project. 
 
This big drawback of this project is the need for a cursor and keyboard to use this site, meaning targeting mobile is extraordinarily hard.
